Computer guy interested in lifting, history and robotics.

Modeling stuff since 2012, programming stuff since 2017. I wanted to have a real Computer Science degree after making games for mobile game publishers for some time.

Working with 3D, visualization, making simulators and applying real-life situations on the IDE's are sorta best things I do. 

Screenies and small explanations from some work I made.
